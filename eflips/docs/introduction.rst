What is eFLIPS, why and how was it developed, what can it do, why is the code crappy, what is the structure of the documentation...?

Use cases:

* Simulate existing schedules to check their electrification potential.
* Build new schedules to serve existing timetables, using greedy scheduling algorithm, and simulate them to obtain energy consumption, fleet size, driver hours, number of charging points required etc. The scheduling algorithm is tailored towards urban bus system applications.
* Determine cost-optimised location of charging points for opportunity charging, using genetic algorithm.
* Calculate annual or lifetime energy consumption for fleet considering the seasonal variation in ambient temperature.
* Determine total cost of ownership (TCO) for electric vehicle fleet.
